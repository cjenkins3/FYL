## FYL

### Project Description:

FYL is an interactive tool that allows the user to enhance their quality of life by actively tracking their annual goals. The application will utilize an API titled ‘Goals’ to incentivize the participation to input what they feel they can accomplish. The user signs in and next enters their goals name.  The tool will timestamp the goals and track it for the user in the database.  The user can delate the goal or change the goals if needed. This is a simple and easy tool for the user to actively track their progress throughout the week, month, and year.
